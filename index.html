    <main><h2>Welcome to My Personal Site</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Nathan Medina and I am a student attending El Camino College. I am an undergraduate student with a Bachelor's 
        Degree in History from California State University, Long Beach. I have returned to school to study CIS and recieve a 
        Certificate of Achievement for Cybersecurity. I have had a large interest in computers for many years and I have sought
        to understand them better and work in a field that could help other's in their issues with computers and other devices.
        I have already finished a semester in the Spring of 2024 and I look forward to the classes in the coming semester!
